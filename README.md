## Overview

This repository presents a reproducible, data-driven workflow for the computational decipherment of the Voynich Manuscript - a 15th-century text that has eluded linguists, historians, and cryptographers for centuries.

Our framework, called the Comprehensive Method and Mapping (CMM), systematically maps Voynich glyphs and multi-glyph tokens to compact Latin roots, applies contextual grammatical reconstruction, and validates results through statistical and linguistic measures.

Latest Results (v3.5, Oct 2025): Across 120+ folios (botanical, astral, baths, poultice, closing sections), mean lexicon alignment to Trotula/Hildegard corpora is 91%; unigram entropy clusters at 3.9 bits; top-10 bigram concentration Z-scores average 18.4 (22% exceeding 30, indicating strong non-random structure); sensitivity drops average 7.1% (with >20% Z-score degradation under 10% perturbations). These metrics reject hoax randomness and support a compressed Late Latin medical manual.

## Key Features

- CMM Workflow: Converts Voynich glyphs to Latin roots to concise English procedural translations.  
- Quantitative Validation: Entropy, type-token ratio, Z-scores, lexicon alignment, and permutation baselines.  
- AI Extension Ready: Framework designed for masked-language model (MLM) perplexity and cross-text validation.  
- Publication-Ready PDF: Automatically generates a polished manuscript with embedded figures and tables.

## Usage

1. Generate Metrics and Translations  
   ```bash
   python voynich_pipeline.py
   ```
   This produces:
   - output/metrics.csv
   - output/decoded_folios.csv

2. Build the PDF Manuscript  
   ```bash
   python make_pdf.py --decoded output/decoded_folios.csv --metrics output/metrics.csv --image input/IMG_3532.jpg --out output/Voynich_Decipherment.pdf
   ```

The script generates figures, inserts manuscript imagery, formats methods and discussion sections, and outputs a publication-ready PDF.

## Figures

- Figure 1: Z-score Distribution - entropy-based statistical validation
  ![Z-score Distribution](figs/hist.png)
- Figure 2: Lexicon Alignment by Folio - top and bottom performing folios
  ![Lexicon Alignment](figs/align.png)

Both figures are generated automatically into the output/figs/ directory and embedded into the PDF.

## Sorting Logic for Folios

The helper function _folio_sort_cols() ensures natural sorting (e.g., 9r, 9v, 10r, 10v, 11r, 11v, ...).  
It parses numeric and side indicators so that folio 111r does not appear directly after 10r.

## Acknowledgments
This work utilizes EVA transcriptions from voynich.nu as the base text for glyph analysis. We acknowledge and thank the Voynich manuscript research community, particularly Rene Zandbergen and Gabriel Landini, for their invaluable contributions to transcription standards and open resources.

Special thanks to the interdisciplinary community of linguists, historians, and AI researchers who have contributed insights into the Voynich mystery. This analysis pays homage to Trotula de' Ruggiero - a 12th-century physician whose pioneering work in women's health continues to inspire scientific rediscovery.
